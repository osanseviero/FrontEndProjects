RSS Reader Project
===============

Overview
--------
This project is part of Udacity Front End Nanodegree and shows how to use jasmine testing framework and use TDD in a web application.

Additionally, there is an input field that allows the users to filter the locations by name. Thanks to the use of Knockout observables, the map refreshes without the user having to refresh the website.

Running Instructions
--------
To run the website, first, open a local python server.

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

All the tests are shown at the bottom of the website. To remove the tests, you can unlink the feedreader.js file at the bottom of the html file.
